				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<p>
					Hi there! My name is Alex Wilson, I'm a 23 year old airline pilot and aspiring developer.
					Having been interested in technology from an early age, I have taken the deep dive into
					development. There is something fascinating about being able to talk to computers and the
					satisfaction when your program works is something to behold. I started my journey through
					watching YouTube, before finding Codecademy. Since joining Codecademy, I have completed
					several skill paths gaining an understanding in Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. If you
					could take the time to look through my projects below, I would be very grateful. Feel free
					to contact me if you have any further questions or would like to discuss using my
					services.

				<h2>My Skills</h2>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<h3>Non-Technical</h3>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Workload Management</h4>
					<p>
						I take a pragmatic approach to my work. Seeing things as black-and-white, I am literal
						and disinclined to waste time on unnecessary activities that don't have a clear purpose.
						Staying calm, relaxed and careful allows me to reach decisions without being impulsive.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Communication</h4>
					<p>
						My experiences have allowed me to operate with a variety of different people and
						stakeholders, holding my own with most people in most situations. Prioritising what, how
						and who to communicate with, I can convey messages and information clearly, accuratley
						and in a timely manner.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Situation Awareness</h4>
					<p>
						Self-assured and reliant, I can operate in a robust and unworried manner in most
						stressful situations. Being reasonably aware of my own feelings and the feelings of
						others, I can anticipate likely events and plan accordingly.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Problem Solving and Decision Making</h4>
					<p>
						Through identifying and verifying why things have gone wrong and not jumping to
						conlcusions, I am less fallible to making uninformed decisions. While also having the
						humility to review and change decisions as more information comes to light.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Leadership and Teamwork</h4>
					<p>
						I am happy to take responsibility when needed and work under my own initiative. Creating
						an open atmosphere to give and recieve both criticism and praise, where teams can be
						open and honest about thoughts, concerns and intentions.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<h3>Technical</h3>
				<div class="break"></div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Python</h4>
					<p>
						I started my coding journey with Python. After watching Youtube videos and following
						various tutorials on the internet, I signed up to the Codecademy website, completing the
						Data Science Career Path. Since then I have done various mini projects and coding
						challenges using the Python language. You can view them on the projects page.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>HTML</h4>
					<p>
						After completing the Data Science Career Path, I set too on the Full Stack Developer
						Career Path. On this path I have gained an understanding of the HTML language, where I
						am now able to build basic webpages, again please see my projects for further examples.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>CSS</h4>
					<p>
						The Full Stack Career Path has also allowed me to gain the skills for basic styling in
						CSS. Although not entirely proficient, I am able to provide websites with basic styling,
						also making websites responsive through flexbox and grid.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Javascript</h4>
					<p>
						I have a basic understanding of Javascript, I am still in the process of learning the
						wide array of userbillity of Javascript and will be doing further development in the
						future.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skill-container">
					<h4>Other</h4>
					<p>
						Other skills I have are a good understanding of various other computer processes,
						including Git and Linux. I am also currently completing a part time degree in Economics
						and Maths at the Open University.
