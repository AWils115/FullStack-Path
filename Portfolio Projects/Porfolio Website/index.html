				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hi there! My name is Alex Wilson, I'm a 23 year old airline pilot and aspiring developer.
					Having been interested in technology from an early age, I have taken the deep dive into
					development. There is something fascinating about being able to talk to computers and the
					satisfaction when your program works is something to behold. I started my journey through
					watching YouTube, before finding Codecademy. Since joining Codecademy, I have completed
					several skill paths gaining an understanding in Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. If you
					could take the time to look through my projects below, I would be very grateful. Feel free
					to contact me if you have any further questions or would like to discuss using my
					services.
				</p>
				<h2>My Skills</h2>
				<h3>Non-Technical</h3>
				<h4>Workload Management</h4>
				<p>
					I take a pragmatic approach to my work. Seeing things as black-and-white, I am literal and
					disinclined to waste time on unnecessary activities that don't have a clear purpose.
					Staying calm, relaxed and careful allows me to reach decisions without being impulsive.
				</p>
				<h4>Communication</h4>
				<p>
					My experiences have allowed me to operate with a variety of different people and
					stakeholders, holding my own with most people in most situations. Prioritising what, how
					and who to communicate with, I can convey messages and information clearly, accuratley and
					in a timely manner.
				</p>
				<h4>Situation Awareness</h4>
				<p>
					Self-assured and reliant, I can operate in a robust and unworried manner in most stressful
					situations. Being reasonably aware of my own feelings and the feelings of others, I can
					anticipate likely events and plan accordingly.
				</p>
				<h4>Problem Solving and Decision Making</h4>
				<p>
					Through identifying and verifying why things have gone wrong and not jumping to
					conlcusions, I am less fallible to making uninformed decisions. While also having the
					humility to review and change decisions as more information comes to light.
				</p>
				<h4>Leadership and Teamwork</h4>
				<p>
					I am happy to take responsibility when needed and work under my own initiative. Creating
					an open atmosphere to give and recieve both criticism and praise, where teams can be open
					and honest about thoughts, concerns and intentions.
