						Hi there! My name is Alex Wilson, I'm a 23 year old airline pilot and aspiring
						developer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, I hope you find something you

				<h2>More About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Having been interested in technology from an early age, I have taken the deep dive into
					development. There is something fascinating about being able to talk to computers and the
					satisfaction when your program works is something to behold. I started my journey through
					watching YouTube, before finding Codecademy. Since joining Codecademy, I have completed
					several skill paths gaining an understanding in Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS. If you
					could take the time to look through my projects below, I would be very grateful.

						<h4>Workload Management</h4>
						<p>
							I take a pragmatic approach to my work. Seeing things as black-and-white, I am literal
							and disinclined to waste time on unnecessary activities that don't have a clear
							purpose. Staying calm, relaxed and careful allows me to reach decisions without being
							impulsive.
						</p>
						<img src="./Resources/Icons/chat.png" alt="" loading="lazy" class="icon icon-card" />
						<h4>Communication</h4>
						<p>
							My experiences have allowed me to operate with a variety of different people and
							stakeholders, holding my own with most people in most situations. Prioritising what,
							how and who to communicate with, I can convey messages and information clearly,
							accuratley and in a timely manner.
						</p>
						<img
							src="./Resources/Icons/telepathy.png"
							alt=""
							loading="lazy"
							class="icon icon-card"
						/>
						<h4>Situation Awareness</h4>
						<p>
							Self-assured and reliant, I can operate in a robust and unworried manner in most
							stressful situations. Being reasonably aware of my own feelings and the feelings of
							others, I can anticipate likely events and plan accordingly.
						</p>
						<img src="./Resources/Icons/idea.png" alt="" loading="lazy" class="icon icon-card" />
						<h4>Problem Solving and Decision Making</h4>
						<p>
							Through identifying and verifying why things have gone wrong and not jumping to
							conlcusions, I am less fallible to making uninformed decisions. While also having the
							humility to review and change decisions as more information comes to light.
						</p>
						<img
							src="./Resources/Icons/leadership.png"
							alt=""
							loading="lazy"
							class="icon icon-card"
						/>
						<h4>Leadership and Teamwork</h4>
						<p>
							I am happy to take responsibility when needed and work under my own initiative.
							Creating an open atmosphere to give and recieve both criticism and praise, where teams
							can be open and honest about thoughts, concerns and intentions.

					<h4>Python</h4>
					<p>
						I started my coding journey with Python. After watching Youtube videos and following
						various tutorials on the internet, I signed up to the Codecademy website, completing the
						Data Science Career Path. Since then I have done various mini projects and coding
						challenges using the Python language. You can view them on the projects page.

						class="icon icon-card"

					<h4>HTML</h4>
					<p>
						After completing the Data Science Career Path, I set too on the Full Stack Developer
						Career Path. On this path I have gained an understanding of the HTML language, where I
						am now able to build basic webpages, again please see my projects for further examples.
					</p>
					<img
						src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-original-wordmark.svg"
						loading="lazy"
						class="icon icon-card"
					/>
					<h4>CSS</h4>
					<p>
						The Full Stack Career Path has also allowed me to gain the skills for basic styling in
						CSS. Although not entirely proficient, I am able to provide websites with basic styling,
						also making websites responsive through flexbox and grid.
					</p>
					<img

					<h4>Javascript</h4>
					<p>
						I have a basic understanding of Javascript, I am still in the process of learning the
						wide array of userbillity of Javascript and will be doing further development in the
						future.
					</p>
					<img src="./Resources/Icons/more.png" alt="" loading="lazy" class="icon icon-card" />
					<h4>Other</h4>
					<p>
						Other skills I have are a good understanding of various other computer processes,
						including Git and Linux. I am also currently completing a part time degree in Economics
						and Maths at the Open University.
